# Dataset Information

This directory does **not** contain the full dataset due to **privacy, ethical considerations, and file size limitations**.
Only a limited number of sample images are included for demonstration purposes.

## Dataset Overview

- **Imaging Modality:** Panoramic Dental X-Ray (OPG)
- **Task Type:** Object Detection
- **Image Format:** JPEG / PNG
- **Annotation Format:** YOLO (normalized bounding boxes)

### Target Classes
- Implant
- Filling
- Root Canal

## Data Annotation Process

The dataset was manually annotated using **Maxense.ai**, a professional medical image annotation platform.

Key aspects of the annotation process:
- Bounding boxes were drawn around clinically relevant regions.
- All annotations follow the **YOLO object detection format**.
- Class definitions were standardized before annotation to ensure consistency.

To improve annotation quality:
- The labeling process was carried out **with the assistance of a domain expert**.
- Ambiguous cases were reviewed and corrected to minimize labeling noise.
- Visual consistency and anatomical correctness were prioritized.

## Data Source and Purpose

The dataset was collected and prepared as part of an **academic graduation project** at:

**Dicle University**  
Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering

The primary goal of the dataset is to support research and experimentation
in **deep learning–based dental image analysis**.

## Ethical and Privacy Considerations

Due to the medical nature of the data:
- Full-resolution dental X-ray images are **not publicly shared**.
- All patient-identifiable information has been removed.
- The dataset is used strictly for **educational and research purposes**.

## Sample Data

Only a small subset of anonymized sample images is included in this repository
to demonstrate:
- Dataset structure
- Annotation format
- Model training and inference pipeline
